								<p>Mafunzo has been conceptualized and created as an organization to design and deliver training, mentoring, and skill development requirements across the spectrum for our discerning clients.
To us at Mafunzo, training is a method to manage and sustain change, develop a skill, refocus knowledge and re-define attitude via structured interventions aimed at optimizing performance. As such, continuous learning and improvement is critical to an individual or an  organization and impacts their desired outcome for any activity directly or indirectly.
This underlying principle helps us design and deliver structured practical training interventions that impact outcome, business or otherwise, positively. By positive impact we mean that our programs or solutions provide the right blend of knowledge and skills to our trainees / students / participants to enable them to perform a job more effectively.
At Mafunzo, we draw on our extensive corporate and entrepreneurial experience of customer lifecycle value and continuous improvement to enable us to deliver these interventions more effectively. Our intense focus on the customized designing of learning programs, the adaptive methodology and the quality of delivery ensure that we meet the requirements each and every time.

								<h2>About Us</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Our wealth of experience enables us to deliver training interventions across diverse groups. Each of our empanelled facilitators has extensive experience in the corporate world spanning decades. We understand the critical correlation between training and the impact on business. We firmly believe that solutions cannot be generalized to a one-size-fits-all approach and hence, we ensure that our solutions are customized to our clients need.
Each of our core team members bring their unique set of industry and training experience to Mafunzo. Power, Infrastructure, Retail, BFSI, Retail, Hospitality, and Real Estate are some of the industries where members of our core team have previously thrived. This, when added to the impeccable academic pedigree that each member possesses, help us create cutting-edge solutions and programs that are of immense value.
Each of our customized interventions - whether it is job oriented skill creation, maximizing productivity, improving customer satisfaction, improving service quality, team-building, or enhancing leadership capability, enable and empower our participants to create value for themselves and their employers.
At Mafunzo, we use several training methodologies to address the training objectives. Some of them are conventional - like class room sessions. Others are more experiential through case-studies, role-plays , in-basket, T-group, role play, and coaching. We also deliver customized consulting and mentoring solutions in the Human Capital space.
